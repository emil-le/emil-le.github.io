Emil Le 2021-03-27 Preface The full abstract can be access through this link. Medical data analysis has been growing as an important field that assist and process non-linear data. Applications can be of results from sub-field of computer vision, which includes difficult tasks such as segmentation and finding visual correspondence. However, there are many important practical invariant about medical data that are hard to incorporate in methodologies in a meaningful manners. Computational algebraic topology including persistence homology, one of the tool used in topological data analysis, rises as an approach to study the shape of high-dimensional data and provide dimensionality reduction method that is robust to noises. In this capstone project, we investigate on the algebraic version of Morse theory (discrete Morse theory) with its applications in medical image segmentation and gene co-expression network analysis. \\[\\text{Figure: Sublevel set persistence of a 3D plot.}\\] "],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation 1.2 Morse Theory 1.3 Algebraic topology", " Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation Topological data analysis (TDA) is field in applied mathematics that challenges the task of extracting and understand information of noisy and incomplete high-dimensional data, which in general is a difficult problem. As both global and local behavior of data are important, TDA aims to find the quantitative topological features that are robust. In differential topology, Morse theory analyzes differential functions (more specifically, the Morse functions) on manifolds to understand the topology of those manifolds. One of the basic results from Morse theory is that most functions on manifolds are Morse functions, and a good choice of a Morse function on a manifold can inform a lot about that manifold. Borrowing both ideas from TDA and Morse theory, discrete Morse theory is constructed in similar way in the combinatoric setting in order to compute the homology or denoise a space. 1.2 Morse Theory The fundamental idea of Morse theory is the invariant of critical points of a sensible differential function on a manifold, so what is consider a sensible function? In the simplest term, Morse functions are differential functions whose critical points satisfying some specific conditions. Before we get into this idea, let’s consider this example below to see that how the critical points are important information of a manifold. \\[\\text{Figure 1.1: Critical points of a terrain.}\\] Example Let’s consider a unit sphere \\(S^2\\subset \\mathbb{R}^3\\) with a function that collapse the sphere into the \\(z-\\)axis: \\[ \\begin{aligned} S^2 = \\{(x,y,z)&amp;\\vert x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\\} \\\\ \\\\ f\\text{ }: S^2 &amp;\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\\\ (x,y,z)&amp;\\longmapsto z \\end{aligned} \\] The gradient of \\(f\\) is \\(\\nabla f = [0 \\text{ } 0 \\text{ }1]^\\text{T}\\). Let \\(m\\in\\mathbb{R}\\), we can see that the critical point of \\(f\\) encodes information about the sub-level set of \\(S^2\\): Let \\(m\\subset \\mathcal{R}\\), consider the pre-image of M under \\(f\\): \\[ f^{-1}(m) = \\begin{cases} \\emptyset &amp;\\text{ if } m &lt; -1\\\\ (0,0,1)&amp;\\text{ if } m = -1\\\\ \\text{a circle } &amp;\\text{ if } -1&lt; m &lt; -1\\\\ (0,0,-1) &amp; \\text{ if } m &lt; = 1\\\\ \\emptyset &amp;\\text{ if } m &gt; 1 \\end{cases} \\] \\[\\text{Figure 1.2: Critical points of a 2-sphere.}\\] \\[ f^{-1}((-\\infty,m]) = \\begin{cases} \\emptyset &amp;\\text{ if } m &lt; -1\\\\ \\text{a point }&amp;\\text{ if } m = -1\\\\ \\text{a half-sphere } &amp;\\text{ if } -1&lt; m &lt; -1\\\\ S^2 &amp; \\text{ if } m \\geq 1\\\\ \\end{cases} \\] \\[\\text{Figure 1.3: Sublevel pre-image on the 2-sphere domain.}\\] Similarly, let’s take the same function to apply on a torus \\(T^2\\subset\\mathbb{R}^3\\): \\[\\text{Figure 1.4: Sublevel pre-image on the torus domain.}\\] Here, we can see that the critical points of the \\(2-\\)sphere and \\(2-\\)torus with its sub-level set from the height function can tell the 2 spaces apart from the number of \\(n-\\)dimensional holes. Intuitively, these are the specific topological signature of some shapes in spaces. Here, let’s recall some key definition of critical points in a differential manifold setting. Definition (Manifold) An \\(n-\\)manifold \\(\\mathcal{M}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a \\(T_2\\) topological space (Hausdorff and with countable basis), where there exists a neighborhood \\(U\\subseteq \\mathcal{M}\\) for every \\(m\\in\\mathcal{M}\\) such that \\(U\\) is homeomorphic to an open ball in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) induced by the Eucledian metric. Note The definition of manifold in topology refers to manifold with boundary, and manifold without boundary are not manifold. \\[\\text{Figure 1.5: The torus is a manifold but the mobius strip is not.}\\] Definition (Critical Point) For an \\(n-\\)manifold \\(\\mathcal{M}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n\\), let \\(f: \\mathcal{M} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\). An critical point of \\(f\\) is \\(x\\in\\mathcal{M}\\) such that \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0\\) \\[ \\begin{aligned}\\text{Figure 1.6:} &amp;\\text{ (Top row) Minimum critical point and maximum critical point.}\\\\ &amp;\\text{ (Bottom row) Saddle critical point.} \\end{aligned} \\] Intuitively, a Morse function is a function maps a manifold domain to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with all critical points are non-degenerative (local maximum, minimum, or saddle point). However, a function on a manifold domain does not have second-derivative, but we can define it on local point. Definition (Nondegenerative) Let \\(x \\in \\mathcal{M}\\) be a critical point of \\(f: \\mathcal{M} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\). Consider the tangent space at \\(x\\), \\(T_x\\mathcal{M}\\), let \\(\\vec{\\mathbf{u}},\\vec{\\mathbf{v}} \\in T_x\\mathcal{M}\\) be arbitrary. Define \\(\\partial^{2} f_x(\\vec{\\mathbf{u}},\\vec{\\mathbf{v}}) = \\vec{\\mathbf{u}}(\\bar{\\vec{\\mathbf{v}}}f)(x)\\) (where \\(\\bar{\\vec{\\mathbf{v}}}\\) is an local extension of \\(\\vec{v}\\)), then the Hessians for \\(f\\) is given by: \\[ \\begin{align} \\mathbf{H}_{f_{ij}} &amp;\\equiv \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{i} \\partial x_{j} } \\\\ \\mathbf{H}_{f} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{1}^2} &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{1} \\partial x_{2} } &amp; \\dots &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{1} \\partial x_{n} } \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{2} \\partial x_{1} } &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{2}^2 } &amp; \\dots &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{2} \\partial x_{n} } \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp;\\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{n}\\partial x_{1}} &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{n} \\partial x_{2} } &amp; \\dots &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{n}^2 } \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align} \\] The critical point \\(x\\) is non-degenerative if its Hessian matrix is invertible. Definition (Morse Function) A Morse function is a function that the Hessian value of every critical point is non-degenerative. There are several interesting results from Morse theory that are out of scope for the project. However, informally speaking, one of the relevant finding is that most functions are Morse function. Recall in calculus III, we can approximate a function by its Taylor expansion to the second derivative at a point \\(a\\) in the domain: \\[f(x) \\approx f(a) + \\frac{1}{1!}f&#39;(a)(x-a) + \\frac{1}{2!}f&#39;&#39;(a)(x-a)^2\\] Then the Morse lemma states that for a Morse function \\(f\\) with critical point \\(a\\), then there exists a local chart \\((x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n)\\) such that: \\[f(x) = f(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n) = f(a) - \\sum_{i=1}^jx_i^2 + \\sum_{i=j+1}^nx_i^2 \\] Furthermore, for a compact manifold \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), its critical values are only dependent on \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) regardless of choices for the Morse function. There are many fascinating applications of Morse theory in dynamics system, density estimation, etc, however, this project focuses on the discrete version of Morse theory. Namely, we apply the similar idea from persistence homology to find the persistence critical points from the triangulation of our inputs. 1.3 Algebraic topology In simplest term, topologists differentiate abstract spaces by finding its homeomorphic invariants such as compactness, Hausdorff property, connectivity, etc. Algebraic topology turns abstract topological space into combinatorical object to study and compute topological invariant in “holes” of a space using linear algbera. Definition A \\(k-\\)simplex \\(\\Delta = [v_0,v_1\\dots,v_n]\\) is the smallest convex subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) containing \\(k+1\\) points which are affinitely independent. \\[ \\begin{aligned}\\text{Figure 1.7:} &amp;\\text{ From left to right respectively, a 0-simpliex (a point), 1-simplex (an edge),}\\\\ &amp;\\text{ 2-simplex (a filled triangle) and 3-simplex (a filled tetrahedron).} \\end{aligned} \\] Morse theory study a another type of invariant of differentiable manifold by looking at its differential function, specifically its critical values, defined on that space. Discrete Morse theory uses the same idea by turning these gradient field into “simpler” complexes that can represent the topological space.

Definition Discrete Morse function For a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), a discrete Morse function \\(f:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) is one satisfying the two conidtions: \\(\\text{Card}\\left\\{\\Delta^n_\\alpha \\big\\vert f(\\Delta^n_\\alpha)\\leq f(\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta), \\Delta^n_\\alpha\\in\\partial\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta\\right\\} \\leq 1\\) for all \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{X}\\). \\(\\text{Card}\\left\\{\\Delta^{n+2}_\\gamma \\big\\vert f(\\Delta^{n+2}_\\gamma)\\leq f(\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta), \\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta\\in\\partial\\Delta^{n+2}_\\gamma\\right\\} \\leq 1\\) for all \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{X}\\). Example For a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) Definition: Critical simplex For a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) with a discrete Morse function \\(f:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), a simplex \\(\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta\\in\\mathcal{X}\\) is a critical simplex if: \\(\\text{Card}\\left\\{\\Delta^n_\\alpha \\big\\vert f(\\Delta^n_\\alpha)\\leq f(\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta), \\Delta^n_\\alpha\\in\\partial\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta\\right\\} = 0\\) for all \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{X}\\). \\(\\text{Card}\\left\\{\\Delta^{n+2}_\\gamma \\big\\vert f(\\Delta^{n+2}_\\gamma)\\leq f(\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta), \\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta\\in\\partial\\Delta^{n+2}_\\gamma\\right\\} =0\\) for all \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{X}\\). If \\(\\Delta\\) is a critical simplex, then \\(f(\\Delta)\\) is a critical value. In the case of 3D images, the critical cells of dimensions 0, 1, 2 and 3 correspond to minima, 1-saddles, 2-saddles and maxima, respectively, in the scalar field. Definition Discrete vector field A discrete vector field (or a Morse pairing) \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) for a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) is a collection of pairs of simplices \\((\\Delta^n_\\alpha,\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta)\\) (\\(\\forall\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{K}\\)) such that each simplex appear in at most a pair. In graph representation \\(G=(V,E)\\) of \\(\\mathcal{V}\\), the vertex set \\(V\\) denote the simplicies of \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) and the edge set is defined as \\(E = \\{e\\in \\mathcal{V}\\}\\). Definition Hasse diagram Let \\(G = (V,E)\\) be a directed graph with \\(V\\) are the set consisting of simplicies in a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) with discrete vector field \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). An directed edge \\((\\tau,\\sigma)\\in E\\) in the edge set \\(E\\) if \\(\\sigma\\in\\partial\\tau\\). A (modified) Hasse diagram \\(H=(V,E&#39;)\\) is a directed graph with the same vertex set \\(V\\) of \\(G\\), and an edge \\((\\tau,\\sigma)\\in E&#39;\\) if \\(e\\in E\\) with the exception that the direction of \\((\\tau,\\sigma)\\) would be changed to an opposite direction \\((\\sigma,\\tau)\\) if there is a vector from \\(\\tau\\) to \\(\\sigma\\) in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). Example Definition Gradient vector field A discrete Morse function defines a discrete vector field (gradient Morse pairing) by pairing (\\((\\Delta^n_\\alpha,\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta)\\)) whenever \\(f(\\Delta^n_\\alpha)&lt;f(\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta)\\). The critical cells are precisely those that do not appear in any pair. Discrete vector fields that arise from Morse functions are called gradient vector fields. Definition V-Path A V-path of gradient vector field \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is a sequence of simplicies \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{V}\\) such that: \\[P=\\{\\sigma^{n}_{0},\\tau^{n+1}_{0},\\sigma^{n}_{1},\\tau^{n+1}_{1},\\sigma^{n}_{2},\\tau^{n}_{2},\\dots,\\sigma^{n}_{r-1},\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1},\\sigma^{n}_{r}\\}\\] where \\(\\sigma^n_i\\in\\partial\\tau^{n+1}_i\\) for \\(i=0,1,\\dots,r-1\\). A V-path is trivial if \\(r = 0\\). and is closed if \\(r&gt;0\\) and \\(\\sigma^n_r=\\sigma^n_0\\). Theorem A discrete vector field is the gradient vector field of a discrete Morse function if and only if there are no non-trivial closed V-paths and every V-path is unique. Proof (\\(\\implies\\)) Assume a discrete vector field \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is a gradient vector field inducded by discrete Morse function \\(f\\) on a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\). By way of contradiction, assume there is a closed V-path \\(P=\\{\\sigma^{n}_{0},\\tau^{n+1}_{0},\\sigma^{n}_{1},\\tau^{n+1}_{1},\\sigma^{n}_{2},\\tau^{n}_{2},\\dots,\\sigma^{n}_{r-1},\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1},\\sigma^{n}_{r},\\sigma^{n}_{0}\\}\\) in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). Since every simplex in \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) appears in at most one pair in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) and by definition of the discrete Morse function, we have: \\[f(\\sigma^{n}_{0})&lt; f(\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1}) &lt;\\dots &lt; f(\\sigma^{n}_{r})&lt;f(\\sigma^{n}_{0})\\] This is a contradiction, so there would be no closed V-path in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). Similarly, if there were any trivial path in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\), then \\(f(\\sigma^{n}_{0})&lt;f(\\sigma^{n}_{0})\\) is also a contradiction. ( \\(\\Longleftarrow\\) ) Assume there exists a discrete vector field \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) contains no trivial or closed V-path, then there exists a discrete Morse function on \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). Lemma 1 If discrete gradient \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) has a closed \\(V-\\)path if the corresponding Hasse diagram \\(H\\) is acyclic. By using contraposition, we show that if the corresponding Hasse diagram \\(H\\) of discrete gradient \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is cyclic then there exists a closed \\(V-\\)path. Supposed that \\(H\\) has a cycle \\(C\\), then \\(C\\) can only contains simplicies of \\(k\\) and \\((k+1)-\\)dimension for some \\(k \\leq \\dim\\mathcal{K}-1\\). By way of contradiction, assume the cycle \\(C\\) contains some simplicies of dimension \\(d\\) such that \\(d\\neq k,k+1\\). Without loss of generality, assume \\(d&lt;k\\). Since at every sub-path in \\(C\\), we must move up or down in 1 dimension, if there exists \\(\\Delta^d\\) in the cycle, then we would have moved up \\(k-d+1\\) times from \\(\\Delta_i^d\\) to \\(\\Delta_j^k\\). This implies there are \\(k-d\\) simplicies appearing in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\): (\\(\\Delta_i^d,\\alpha^{d+1}\\)), (\\(\\alpha^{d+1},\\alpha^{d+2}\\)), \\(\\dots\\), (\\(\\alpha^{k-1},\\Delta_j^{k}\\)). This is a contradiction since every simplicies must appear in at most 1 pair, so cycle \\(C\\) must only contain contains simplicies of \\(k\\) and \\((k+1)-\\)dimension for some \\(k\\). Again, since the cycle \\(C\\) of some simplicies of \\(k\\) and \\((k+1)-\\)dimension, assume of length \\(2n+1\\), each upward arrows represents \\((\\Delta^k_i,\\Delta^{k+1}_i)\\in\\mathcal{V}\\) for \\(i=0,1,\\dots,n-1\\) satisfying \\(\\Delta^k_i\\in\\partial\\Delta^{k+1}_i\\) and \\(a_i\\neq a_{i+1}\\). Since \\(C\\) is cyclic, then there is an arrow from \\(\\Delta^k_n\\) to \\(\\Delta^k_0\\) (\\((\\Delta^k_0,\\Delta^k_n)\\in\\mathcal{V}\\)), which gives us a closed path \\((\\Delta^k_0,\\Delta^{k+1}_0,\\Delta^k_1,\\Delta^{k+1}_1,\\dots,\\Delta^k_{n-1},\\Delta^{k+1}_{n-1},\\Delta^k_n=\\Delta^k_0)\\) in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). QED. Lemma 2 Let \\(H = (V,E)\\) be a finite directed graph. Then \\(H\\) is acylic iff there exists \\(f: V\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) satisfying \\(f(v_i)&gt;f(v_j)\\) (\\(i\\neq j\\)) for arbitrary \\(v_i,v_j\\in V\\) and \\((v_i,v_j)\\in H\\). (\\(\\implies\\)) Assume there exists such \\(f\\), by way of contradiction, assume there exists a cycle in \\(H\\): \\((v_0,v_1,\\dots v_n,v_0)\\). Then we have \\(f(v_0)&gt;f(v_1)&gt;\\dots&gt;f(v_n)&gt;f(v_0)\\), which is a contradictoin. Thus, \\(H\\) is acyclic. (\\(\\Longleftarrow\\)) Assume \\(H\\) is acyclic, let \\(V&#39;\\subseteq V\\) be defined as \\(V&#39; = \\{v\\in V \\vert \\exists v&#39;\\in V \\text{ s.t. } (v,v&#39;)\\in E\\}\\) with \\(I\\) be the fixed index set of \\(v\\in V&#39;\\). Let \\(d = \\dim V&#39;\\), define function \\(f: V\\to \\mathbb{R}\\) that maps \\(v_i \\mapsto d - i\\) for \\(i=0,1,2,\\dots,d-1\\). Since the index set is fixed, if \\(i&gt;j\\) and \\((v_i,v_j)\\in E\\) then \\(f(v_i)&gt;f(v_j)\\) so \\(f\\) is the satisfied function. By Lemma 1, since \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) contains no closed path, then the corresponding Hasse diagram \\(H= (V,E)\\) is acyclic. By Lemma 2, there exists \\(f: V\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) satisfying \\(f(v_i)&gt;f(v_j)\\) (\\(i\\neq j\\)) for arbitrary \\(v_i,v_j\\in V\\) and \\((v_i,v_j)\\in H\\). Every vertex of \\(H\\) is an \\(k-\\)simplex of \\(\\mathcal{K}\\). If we defined the fixed index set of \\(H\\) based on the dimension of the simplex, then \\(f\\) maps a higher-dimensional simplices to a higher value. Furthermore, since \\(H\\) is acyclic, then every simplex appears in at most 1 pair of simplicies in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). Thus, \\(f\\) is the satisfied discrete Morse function on \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) so \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is a gradient vector field. Theorem Morse cancellation / simplification. Let f be a discrete Morse function on \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) such that \\(\\Delta^n_0,\\Delta^{n+1}_0\\) are critical simplices. Suppose there exists a non-trivial V-path of gradient vector field \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) induced by \\(f\\) \\[P=\\{\\sigma = \\sigma^{n}_{0},\\tau^{n+1}_{0},\\sigma^{n}_{1},\\tau^{n+1}_{1},\\sigma^{n}_{2},\\tau^{n}_{2},\\dots,\\sigma^{n}_{r-1},\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1},\\sigma^{n}_{r},\\tau^n_r=\\tau\\}\\] satisfying \\(\\sigma^n_i\\in\\partial\\tau^{n+1}_i\\) with pairing \\(\\{\\tau^{n+1}_{i},\\sigma^n_{i+1}\\}\\) for \\(i=0,1,\\dots,r\\). Then there exists another discrete Morse function \\(f&#39;\\) on \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) such that it has the same critical simplicies as \\(f\\) but \\(\\sigma,\\tau\\) are no longer critical. Proof Define \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) as a collection of pairs of all simplices \\((\\Delta^n_\\alpha,\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta)\\) (\\(\\forall\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{K}\\)) satisfying: \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39; - P = \\mathcal{V} - P\\) \\((\\sigma_i,\\tau_i)\\in \\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) for \\(i=0,1,2,\\dots,r\\) Essentially, we keep the initial pairing of simplicies in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) that does not belong to the path \\(P\\), and assign those to \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\). And for simplicies in \\(P\\) with the original pairing \\(\\{\\tau^{n+1}_{i},\\sigma^n_{i+1}\\}\\), we change to \\((\\sigma_i,\\tau_i)\\) to put those in \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\). By definition, \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) is a discrete vector field because there are no simplicies appearing in more than a pair by the way we construct it. To show that \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) is a gradient vector field (by previous theorem , essentially pointing out there exists a discrete Morse function \\(f&#39;\\) satisfying the property), it’s sufficient to show that the exists no non-trivial closed V-paths and every V-path is unique. From (1), since \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) differs from \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) by \\(P\\) and there are no non-trivial or closed paths in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) by definition, so there would not be any non-trivial paths in \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\). The V-path \\(P\\) is also non-trivial by definition, so if there were any trivial or closed paths in \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\), it would have been in some sub-path of \\(P\\). By way of contradiction, let’s suppose a closed sub-path \\(P_0\\) of \\(P\\) defined by \\(\\sigma^n_k,\\delta_i,\\dots,\\delta_j,\\sigma^n_k\\) for some \\(\\delta_i,\\dots,\\delta_j\\in\\mathcal{K}\\). Then \\(P&#39;= \\{\\sigma = \\sigma^{n}_{0},\\dots,\\sigma^n_k,\\delta_i,\\dots,\\delta_j,\\sigma^n_k,\\dots\\sigma^{n}_{r-1},\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1},\\sigma^{n}_{r},\\tau^n_r=\\tau\\}\\) is another \\(V-\\)path from \\(\\sigma\\) to \\(\\tau\\). This is a contradiction since any \\(V-\\)path from \\(\\sigma\\) to \\(\\tau\\) must be unique. Thus, \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) must not contain any closed V-path. We can show that every V-path in \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) is unique by a similar method. Again, since \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) differs from \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) by \\(P\\) so any V-path in \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;- P\\) is unique. Thus, it is sufficient to show that \\(P&#39;=\\{\\tau^{n+1}_{0},\\sigma^{n}_{1},\\tau^{n+1}_{1},\\sigma^{n}_{2},\\tau^{n}_{2},\\dots,\\sigma^{n}_{r-1},\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1},\\sigma^{n}_{r},\\tau^n_r=\\tau,\\sigma = \\sigma^{n}_{0}\\}\\) is unique. By way of contradiction, assume there exists another \\(V-\\)path from \\(\\tau^{n+1}_{0}\\) to \\(\\sigma\\): \\(P_0=\\{\\sigma = \\sigma^{n}_{0},\\dots,\\sigma^n_k,\\delta_i,\\dots,\\delta_j,\\sigma^n_k,\\dots\\sigma^{n}_{r-1},\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1},\\sigma^{n}_{r},\\tau^n_r=\\tau\\}\\). Then \\(P&#39;\\cup P_0\\) is a closed V-path, which contradicts the fact that \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) must not contain any closed V-path. Therefore, \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) is a gradient vector field of some discrete Morse function \\(f&#39;\\) satisfying that it has the same number of critical simplicies but \\(\\tau\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are no longer critical. 2.2 Morse homology The connection between discrete Morse theory and simple homotopy arises from the pairs in the gradient vector field. The number of critical points modulo 2 of a Morse function depends only on the manifold and not on the function. Definition Chain Complex and Boundary Operator Let \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) be a simplicial complex, and \\(C_n(K)\\) denotes the \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\)-vector space with basis are the set of \\(k-\\)simplices contained in \\(\\mathcal{K}\\).

The main purpose is that \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) is homotopy equivalent to \\(\\mathcal{K}&#39;\\). Definition Level subcomplexes Let \\(c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) be arbitrary, for a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) with a discrete Morse function \\(f:\\mathcal{K}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), the level sub-complexes is one induced by all simplicies \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{K}\\) satisfying \\(f(\\Delta)\\leq c\\) with all of their faces: \\[\\mathcal{K}(c) = \\bigcup_{f(\\Delta)\\leq c}\\bigcup_{\\Delta&#39;\\in\\partial\\Delta} \\Delta\\] Theorem The collapse theorem Let there be a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) with a gradient field \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) induced by an arbitrary discrete Morse function \\(f:\\mathcal{K}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\). For an arbitrary interval \\([a,b]\\) \\((\\forall a,b\\in\\mathbb{R})\\), if there exists no critical simplex \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{K}\\) induced by \\(f\\) such that \\(f(\\Delta_{\\text{Critical}})\\in [a,b]\\) then \\(\\mathcal{K}(b)\\searrow\\mathcal{K}(a)\\). Otherwise, assume there exists an arbitrary \\(k-\\)simplex \\(\\Delta^k\\) (\\(k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\)) such that \\(f(\\Delta^k) \\in [a,b]\\). Proof Let there be a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) with a gradient field \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) induced by an arbitrary discrete Morse function \\(f:\\mathcal{K}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\). Supposed that there exists no critical simplex \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{K}\\) induced by \\(f\\) such that \\(f(\\Delta_{\\text{Critical}})\\in [a,b]\\) for arbitrary interval \\([a,b]\\subset\\mathbb{R}\\). If for all arbitrary simplex \\(\\Delta \\in\\mathcal{K}\\), then \\(f(\\Delta)\\notin[a,b]\\) so \\(\\mathcal{K}(b)\\searrow\\mathcal{K}(a)\\). Otherwise, let \\(\\epsilon &gt;0\\) be arbitrary such that there exists a unique \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{K}\\) satisfying \\(f(\\Delta)\\in [b-\\epsilon,b] \\subset [a,b]\\) . By definition of \\(\\mathcal{V}\\), either: There exists \\(\\Delta^{k} \\in \\mathcal{K}(b)\\) such that \\(\\Delta\\in \\partial\\Delta^{k}\\) and \\(f(\\Delta) \\leq f(\\Delta^{k})\\) Or there exists \\(\\Delta^{k} \\in \\mathcal{K}(b)\\) such that \\(\\Delta^{k} \\in \\partial\\Delta\\) and \\(f(\\Delta^{k}) \\leq f(\\Delta)\\) Without loss of generality, assume there is \\(\\Delta^{k} \\in \\mathcal{K}(b)\\) such that \\(\\Delta \\in \\partial\\Delta^{k}\\) and \\(f(\\Delta) \\leq f(\\Delta^{k})\\), then it must be the case that \\(\\Delta\\) is a free-face of \\(\\Delta^{k}\\) in \\(\\mathcal{K}(b)\\). By way of contradiction, assume \\(\\Delta\\) is not a free-face of \\(\\Delta^{k}(b)\\), then there exists another \\(k-\\)simplex \\(\\tau^k \\in \\mathcal{K}(b)\\) (\\(\\tau^k \\neq \\Delta^k\\)) such that \\(\\Delta\\in\\partial\\tau^k\\). By definition of \\(f\\), it must be that \\(f(\\tau^{k})&gt; f(\\Delta^{k})\\) since \\(\\tau^{k}\\) and \\(\\Delta^{k}\\) are of the dimension and to make sure only 1 co-face of \\(\\Delta\\) has the same Morse value. Since \\(\\tau^k \\in \\mathcal{K}(b)\\): \\[b-\\epsilon &lt; f(\\Delta) \\leq f(\\Delta^K) &lt; f(\\tau^k) &lt; b\\] Since we assume there were no critical simplex in \\([b-\\epsilon,b]\\subset[a,b]\\), then \\(\\tau^k\\) is another regular simplex in \\([b-\\epsilon,b]\\), which is a contradiction since we assume \\(\\Delta^k\\) is the only regular simplex in \\([b-\\epsilon,b]\\). By repeating the same proccess for \\([b-\\epsilon&#39;,b-\\epsilon]\\subset[a,b-\\epsilon]\\) and so on. Thus, it must be that \\(\\Delta\\) is a free-face of \\(\\Delta^k\\) in \\(\\mathcal{K}(b)\\). The case is the same for if there exists \\(\\Delta^{k} \\in \\mathcal{K}(b)\\) such that \\(\\Delta^{k} \\in \\partial\\Delta\\) and \\(f(\\Delta^{k}) \\leq f(\\Delta)\\), therefore it must be true that \\(\\mathcal{K}(b)\\searrow\\mathcal{K}(a)\\). Theorem Lower-star filtration Let \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) be a simplicial complex consisting of \\(m\\) simplices and a function \\(f:V(\\mathcal{K})\\to \\mathbb{R}, v_i\\mapsto\\mathbb{R}\\) that assigning a real value for all vectors contained in any arbitrary simplex in \\(\\mathcal{K}\\). Rewritten arbitrary \\(k-\\)simplex of \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) as collection of vectors \\([v_0,v_1,\\dots,v_{k+1}]\\), define the Morse function \\(f&#39;:\\mathcal{K}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) as \\[f&#39;([v_0,v_1,\\dots,v_{k}])=\\max\\{\\{f(v_i)\\vert i=0,\\dots,k\\}\\}\\] Reordered to simplicies in \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) into an ordered sequences \\(S = \\Delta_1,\\Delta_2,\\dots\\Delta_m\\) where faces of \\(\\Delta_k\\) appears before \\(\\Delta_k\\) for \\(i=1,2,\\dots,m\\). For decreasing \\(\\epsilon_i &gt; 0\\) (\\(i = 0,1,2,\\dots\\))consider the sublevel sets chain complex: \\[\\mathcal{K}_{\\ast}: \\dots \\overset{\\partial_{n+1}}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathcal{K}(\\epsilon_n)\\overset{\\partial_{n}}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathcal{K}(\\epsilon_{n-1})\\overset{\\partial_{n-1}}{\\longrightarrow}\\dots\\overset{\\partial_{4}}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathcal{K}(\\epsilon_{3})\\overset{\\partial_{3}}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathcal{K}(\\epsilon_{2})\\overset{\\partial_{2}}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathcal{K}(\\epsilon_{1})\\overset{\\partial_{1}}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathcal{K}(\\epsilon_{0}) = \\mathcal{K}\\] Passing to homology, we have the persistence module \\(H_\\ast = \\bigoplus_{z\\in\\mathbb{Z}_2}H(\\mathcal{K}(\\epsilon_i))\\). A persistent pairing induced by \\(\\mathcal{K}_\\ast\\) is the pair of simplicial complex \\((\\Delta_i,\\Delta_j)\\) for \\(\\Delta_i \\in \\mathcal{K}(\\epsilon_i),\\Delta_j \\in \\mathcal{K}(\\epsilon_j)\\) are the critical simplices of their respective homology class. Let \\(\\text{pers}(\\Delta_i,\\Delta_j) = f&#39;(\\Delta_j)-f&#39;(\\Delta_i)\\) denotes the persistence of all arbitrary persistence-pairing, which indicates the life-time where a critical simplex is created at the time \\(i\\) and destroyed at time \\(j\\). Since not all simplicies can be paired, let creates the a simplex \\(\\Delta_\\infty\\) such that \\(f&#39;(\\Delta_\\infty)\\) be arbitrary large (hence, \\(\\text{pers}(\\Delta,\\Delta_\\infty)=\\infty\\)).

The segmentation of medical image (such as CT scan or MRI) requires high accuracy, however, image noises make this task very difficult as clusters could have broken edges or inaccurate gaps. We we implement the segmentation model that are robust to noise using methods from (). The architecture of the algorithm can be simplified as: \\[\\text{Input Image} \\longrightarrow \\text{Triangulation } \\longrightarrow \\text{Density Map } \\rho \\longrightarrow \\text{Persistence diagram }\\] From the input image, we can represent each pixel as a point in space. For this model, we assume a triangulation \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) from the input images and we only consider the \\(0-\\)simplex, \\(1-\\)simplex, and \\(2-\\)simplex. We extract the manifold from \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) by the grayscale density map \\(\\rho: \\mathcal{K}\\to \\mathbb{R}\\), in this case, we choose the Laplacian of Gaussian spatial filter for the density map. Lastly, we apply the sublevel set filtration to compute the persistence diagram for the critical points of the diagram for noise modeling, critical points that have long survival interval represent the stable feature of the image, while those have short survival interval accounts for noise. Demonstration We used brain tumour MRI and histopathologic colorectal dataset from Kaggle to demonstrate the algorithm. 3.2 Gene co-expression network analysis In this section, we try to identify the topological structure of the gene co-expression networks belong to patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia disorder. Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are psychiatric disorders that has high mortality rates, which makes the task of diagnosis crucial to improve life quality. Symptoms of bipolar disorder includes manic episodes, which are characterized by increased energy with intense delusion thoughts, while schizophrenia disorder includes psychosis, which are characterized by hallucinations and detachment to reality. In general, different symptoms of psychiatric disorders can sometime look similar enough despite being completely separated, which leads to misdiagnosis. Thus, we want define the problem statement, whether using applications from discrete Morse theory and TDA, we can identify significant biomarkers of these two disorders. \\[ \\begin{aligned}\\text{Figure 4.1:} &amp;\\text{ Example of a gene co-expression network.} \\end{aligned} \\] We collect the gene co-expression network data from NCBI. The gene co-expression network is represented as an undirected network \\(G = (V, E)\\), where the vertex set \\(V\\) consists of genes and an edge in the edge set \\(E\\) represents the similarity in expression level between 2 genes. A clique of a network \\(G = (V, E)\\) is a sub-network \\(C\\subset G\\), where two distincts vertices in \\(C\\) are connected by an edge. We used the methods introduced by Kannan et. al. to capture the persistence cliques presented in the gene co-expression networks to compare the two psychiatric disorders. Let \\(g_\\max\\) denotes the maximum degree of \\(G\\), we define the discrete Morse function on the vertex set of\\(G\\), \\(f: V(G)\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), as: \\[f(v) = g_\\max - \\deg(v) + \\epsilon\\] where \\(\\epsilon\\) are randomly generated from the uniform distribution \\(\\text{Uniform}(0,0.5)\\).

The main takes away from the project is that with a good choice of a (discrete) Morse function, its non-degenerative critical points can inform a lot about the topological structure of a space. This project also provides two examples of how we can utilize the ideas of persistence critical points through sublevel sets filtration for potential applications image segmentation and network classification. For future works, there are many other applications that we can utilize these results from discrete Morse theory. For example, this paper uses the same ideas to simplify and reconstruct the road network, and this paper uses critical points cancellation from discrete Morse theory to improve the computation of zig-zag persistence. 4.1 References Audin, M., &amp; Damian, M.
