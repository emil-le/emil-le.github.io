Emil Le 2021-03-22 Preface Medical data analysis has been growing as an important field that assist and process non-linear data. Applications can be of results from sub-field of computer vision, which includes difficult tasks such as segmentation and finding visual correspondence. However, there are many important practical invariant about medical data that are hard to incorporate in methodologies in a meaningful manners. Computational algebraic topology including persistence homology, one of the tool used in topological data analysis, rises as an approach to study the shape of high-dimensional data and provide dimensionality-reduction method that is robust to noises. In this capstone project, we investigate on the algebraic version of Morse theory (discrete Morse theory) with its applications in find and reconstruct the skeletonization of neuron data. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation 1.2 Morse Theory 1.3 Algebraic topology", " Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation Understanding and reconstructing the network architecture of the brain is one of the fundamental task in neuroscience. Typically, neuroanatomical data are usually represented as tree-shape due to its biochemical reaction activity. As both global and local behavior are important characteristics of any network, finding a method to extract the skeletonization of the neurons that preserved the topological structure of neuronal data is necessary. This is more or less the fundamental idea and advantage of topological data analysis methods, which we will explore how Morse theory comes into play. Essentially, the idea of Morse theory (and discrete Morse theory), a field in differential topology, is that a reasonable choice of a function can reflect a lot of information about a topological space. 1.2 Morse Theory The fundamental idea of Morse theory is that a sensible differential function can inform a lot about a manifold, so what is consider a sensible function? Example Consider a unit sphere \\(S^2\\subset \\mathbb{R}^3\\) with the function \\(f\\) that collapse the sphere into the \\(z-\\)axis: \\[ \\begin{aligned} S^2 = \\{(x,y,z)&amp;\\vert x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\\} \\\\ \\\\ f\\text{ }: S^2 &amp;\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\\\ (x,y,z)&amp;\\longmapsto z \\end{aligned} \\] The gradient of \\(f\\) is \\(\\nabla f = [0 \\text{ } 0 \\text{ }1]^\\text{T}\\). Let \\(m\\in\\mathbb{R}\\), we can see that the critical point of \\(f\\) encodes information about the sub-level set of \\(S^2\\): Let \\(m\\subset \\mathcal{R}\\), consider the pre-image of M under \\(f\\): \\[ f^{-1}(m) = \\begin{cases} \\emptyset &amp;\\text{ if } m &lt; -1\\\\ (0,0,1)&amp;\\text{ if } m = -1\\\\ \\text{a circle } &amp;\\text{ if } -1&lt; m &lt; -1\\\\ (0,0,-1) &amp; \\text{ if } m &lt; = 1\\\\ \\emptyset &amp;\\text{ if } m &gt; 1 \\end{cases} \\] \\[ f^{-1}((-\\infty,m]) = \\begin{cases} \\emptyset &amp;\\text{ if } m &lt; -1\\\\ \\text{a point }&amp;\\text{ if } m = -1\\\\ \\text{a half-sphere } &amp;\\text{ if } -1&lt; m &lt; -1\\\\ S^2 &amp; \\text{ if } m \\geq 1\\\\ \\end{cases} \\] Before we get into the definition of a Morse function, let’s recall some key definition: Definition (Manifold) An \\(n-\\)manifold \\(\\mathcal{M}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a \\(T_2\\) topological space (Hausdorff and with countable basis), where there exists a neighborhood \\(U\\subseteq \\mathcal{M}\\) for every \\(m\\in\\mathcal{M}\\) such that \\(U\\) is homeomorphic to an open ball in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) induced by the Eucledian metric. \\[\\text{Figure 2: The torus is a manifold but the mobius strip is not.}\\] Definition (Critical Point) For an \\(n-\\)manifold \\(\\mathcal{M}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n\\), let \\(f: \\mathcal{M} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\). An critical point of \\(f\\) is \\(x\\in\\mathcal{M}\\) such that \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0\\) Intuitively, a Morse function is a function maps a manifold domain to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with all critical points are non-degenerative (local maximum, minimum, or saddle point). However, a function on a manifold domain does not have second-derivative, but we can define it on local point. Definition (Nondegenerative) Let \\(x \\in \\mathcal{M}\\) be a critical point of \\(f: \\mathcal{M} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\). Consider the tangent space at \\(x\\), \\(T_x\\mathcal{M}\\), let \\(\\vec{\\mathbf{u}},\\vec{\\mathbf{v}} \\in T_x\\mathcal{M}\\) be arbitrary. Define \\(\\partial^{2} f(\\vec{\\mathbf{u}},\\vec{\\mathbf{v}}) = \\vec{\\mathbf{u}}(\\vec{\\bar{\\mathbf{v}}}f)(x)\\), then the Hessians for \\(f\\) is given by: \\[ \\begin{align} \\mathbf{H}_{f_{ij}} &amp;\\equiv \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{i} \\partial x_{j} } \\\\ \\mathbf{H}_{f} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{1}^2} &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{1} \\partial x_{2} } &amp; \\dots &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{1} \\partial x_{n} } \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{2} \\partial x_{1} } &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{2}^2 } &amp; \\dots &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{2} \\partial x_{n} } \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp;\\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{n}\\partial x_{1}} &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{n} \\partial x_{2} } &amp; \\dots &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{n}^2 } \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align} \\] Definition (Morse Function) A Morse function is a function that the Hessian value of every critical point is non-degenerative. 1.3 Algebraic topology In simplest term, topologists differentiate abstract spaces by finding its homeomorphic invariants such as compactness, Hausdorff property, connectivity, etc. Algebraic topology turns abstract topological space into combinatorical object to study and compute topological invariant in “holes” of a space using linear algbera. Definition A \\(k-\\)simplex \\(\\Delta = [v_0,v_1\\dots,v_n]\\) is the smallest convex subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) containing \\(k+1\\) points which are affinitely independent. Figure 1.1: Funky tikz Morse theory study a another type of invariant of differentiable manifold by looking at its differential function, specifically its critical values, defined on that space. Discrete Morse theory uses the same idea by turning these gradient field into “simpler” complexes that can represent the topological space.

Figure 2.3: Funky tikz If \\(\\Delta\\) is a critical simplex, then \\(f(\\Delta)\\) is a critical value. In the case of 3D images, the critical cells of dimensions 0, 1, 2 and 3 correspond to minima, 1-saddles, 2-saddles and maxima, respectively, in the scalar field. Definition Discrete vector field A discrete vector field (or a Morse pairing) \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) for a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) is a collection of pairs of simplices \\((\\Delta^n_\\alpha,\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta)\\) (\\(\\forall\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{K}\\)) such that each simplex appear in at most a pair. Definition The Hasse diagram of a simplicial complex X is a directed acyclic graph on the partially ordered set of simplices of X, ordered by the relation Figure 2.4: Funky tikz Definition Gradient vector field A discrete Morse function defines a discrete vector field (gradient Morse pairing) by pairing (\\((\\Delta^n_\\alpha,\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta)\\)) whenever \\(f(\\Delta^n_\\alpha)&lt;f(\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta)\\). The critical cells are precisely those that do not appear in any pair. Discrete vector fields that arise from Morse functions are called gradient vector fields. Definition V-Path A V-path of gradient vector field \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is a sequence of simplicies \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{V}\\) such that: \\[P=\\{\\sigma^{n}_{0},\\tau^{n+1}_{0},\\sigma^{n}_{1},\\tau^{n+1}_{1},\\sigma^{n}_{2},\\tau^{n}_{2},\\dots,\\sigma^{n}_{r-1},\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1},\\sigma^{n}_{r}\\}\\] where \\(\\sigma^n_i\\in\\partial\\tau^{n+1}_i\\) for \\(i=0,1,\\dots,r-1\\). A V-path is trivial if \\(r = 0\\). and is closed if \\(r&gt;0\\) and \\(\\sigma^n_r=\\sigma^n_0\\). Figure 2.5: Funky tikz Theorem A discrete vector field is the gradient vector field of a discrete Morse function if and only if there are no non-trivial closed V-paths and every V-path is unique. Proof (\\(\\implies\\)) Assume a discrete vector field \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is a gradient vector field inducded by discrete Morse function \\(f\\) on a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\). By way of contradiction, assume there is a closed V-path \\(P=\\{\\sigma^{n}_{0},\\tau^{n+1}_{0},\\sigma^{n}_{1},\\tau^{n+1}_{1},\\sigma^{n}_{2},\\tau^{n}_{2},\\dots,\\sigma^{n}_{r-1},\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1},\\sigma^{n}_{r},\\sigma^{n}_{0}\\}\\) in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). Since every simplex in \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) appears in at most one pair in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) and by definition of the discrete Morse function, we have: \\[f(\\sigma^{n}_{0})&lt; f(\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1}) &lt;\\dots &lt; f(\\sigma^{n}_{r})&lt;f(\\sigma^{n}_{0})\\] This is a contradiction, so there would be no closed V-path in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). Similarly, if there were any trivial path in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\), then \\(f(\\sigma^{n}_{0})&lt;f(\\sigma^{n}_{0})\\) is also a contradiction. ( \\(\\Longleftarrow\\) ) Assume there exists a discrete vector field \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) contains no trivial or closed V-path, then there exists a discrete Morse function on \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). Lemma 1 If discrete gradient \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) has a closed \\(V-\\)path if the corresponding Hasse diagram \\(H\\) is acyclic. By using contraposition, we show that if the corresponding Hasse diagram \\(H\\) of discrete gradient \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is cyclic then there exists a closed \\(V-\\)path. Supposed that \\(H\\) has a cycle \\(C\\), then \\(C\\) can only contains simplicies of \\(k\\) and \\((k+1)-\\)dimension for some \\(k \\leq \\dim\\mathcal{K}-1\\). By way of contradiction, assume the cycle \\(C\\) contains some simplicies of dimension \\(d\\) such that \\(d\\neq k,k+1\\). Without loss of generality, assume \\(d&lt;k\\). Since at every sub-path in \\(C\\), we must move up or down in 1 dimension, if there exists \\(\\Delta^d\\) in the cycle, then we would have moved up \\(k-d+1\\) times from \\(\\Delta_i^d\\) to \\(\\Delta_j^k\\). This implies there are \\(k-d\\) simplicies appearing in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\): (\\(\\Delta_i^d,\\alpha^{d+1}\\)), (\\(\\alpha^{d+1},\\alpha^{d+2}\\)), \\(\\dots\\), (\\(\\alpha^{k-1},\\Delta_j^{k}\\)). This is a contradiction since every simplicies must appear in at most 1 pair, so cycle \\(C\\) must only contain contains simplicies of \\(k\\) and \\((k+1)-\\)dimension for some \\(k\\). Again, since the cycle \\(C\\) of some simplicies of \\(k\\) and \\((k+1)-\\)dimension, assume of length \\(2n+1\\), each upward arrows represents \\((\\Delta^k_i,\\Delta^{k+1}_i)\\in\\mathcal{V}\\) for \\(i=0,1,\\dots,n-1\\) satisfying \\(\\Delta^k_i\\in\\partial\\Delta^{k+1}_i\\) and \\(a_i\\neq a_{i+1}\\). Since \\(C\\) is cyclic, then there is an arrow from \\(\\Delta^k_n\\) to \\(\\Delta^k_0\\) (\\((\\Delta^k_0,\\Delta^k_n)\\in\\mathcal{V}\\)), which gives us a closed path \\((\\Delta^k_0,\\Delta^{k+1}_0,\\Delta^k_1,\\Delta^{k+1}_1,\\dots,\\Delta^k_{n-1},\\Delta^{k+1}_{n-1},\\Delta^k_n=\\Delta^k_0)\\) in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). QED. Lemma 2 Let \\(H = (V,E)\\) be a finite directed graph. Then \\(H\\) is acylic iff there exists \\(f: V\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) satisfying \\(f(v_i)&gt;f(v_j)\\) (\\(i\\neq j\\)) for arbitrary \\(v_i,v_j\\in V\\) and \\((v_i,v_j)\\in H\\). (\\(\\implies\\)) Assume there exists such \\(f\\), by way of contradiction, assume there exists a cycle in \\(H\\): \\((v_0,v_1,\\dots v_n,v_0)\\). Then we have \\(f(v_0)&gt;f(v_1)&gt;\\dots&gt;f(v_n)&gt;f(v_0)\\), which is a contradictoin. Thus, \\(H\\) is acyclic. (\\(\\Longleftarrow\\)) Assume \\(H\\) is acyclic, let \\(V&#39;\\subseteq V\\) be defined as \\(V&#39; = \\{v\\in V \\vert \\exists v&#39;\\in V \\text{ s.t. } (v,v&#39;)\\in E\\}\\) with \\(I\\) be the fixed index set of \\(v\\in V&#39;\\). Let \\(d = \\dim V&#39;\\), define function \\(f: V\\to \\mathbb{R}\\) that maps \\(v_i \\mapsto d - i\\) for \\(i=0,1,2,\\dots,d-1\\). Since the index set is fixed, if \\(i&gt;j\\) and \\((v_i,v_j)\\in E\\) then \\(f(v_i)&gt;f(v_j)\\) so \\(f\\) is the satisfied function. By Lemma 1, since \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) contains no closed path, then the corresponding Hasse diagram \\(H= (V,E)\\) is acyclic. By Lemma 2, there exists \\(f: V\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) satisfying \\(f(v_i)&gt;f(v_j)\\) (\\(i\\neq j\\)) for arbitrary \\(v_i,v_j\\in V\\) and \\((v_i,v_j)\\in H\\). Every vertex of \\(H\\) is an \\(k-\\)simplex of \\(\\mathcal{K}\\). If we defined the fixed index set of \\(H\\) based on the dimension of the simplex, then \\(f\\) maps a higher-dimensional simplices to a higher value. Furthermore, since \\(H\\) is acyclic, then every simplex appears in at most 1 pair of simplicies in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). Thus, \\(f\\) is the satisfied discrete Morse function on \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) so \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is a gradient vector field. Theorem Morse cancellation / simplification. Let f be a discrete Morse function on \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) such that \\(\\Delta^n_0,\\Delta^{n+1}_0\\) are critical simplices. Suppose there exists a non-trivial V-path of gradient vector field \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) induced by \\(f\\) \\[P=\\{\\sigma = \\sigma^{n}_{0},\\tau^{n+1}_{0},\\sigma^{n}_{1},\\tau^{n+1}_{1},\\sigma^{n}_{2},\\tau^{n}_{2},\\dots,\\sigma^{n}_{r-1},\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1},\\sigma^{n}_{r},\\tau^n_r=\\tau\\}\\] satisfying \\(\\sigma^n_i\\in\\partial\\tau^{n+1}_i\\) with pairing \\(\\{\\tau^{n+1}_{i},\\sigma^n_{i+1}\\}\\) for \\(i=0,1,\\dots,r\\). Then there exists another discrete Morse function \\(f&#39;\\) on \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) such that it has the same critical simplicies as \\(f\\) but \\(\\sigma,\\tau\\) are no longer critical. Proof Define \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) as a collection of pairs of all simplices \\((\\Delta^n_\\alpha,\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta)\\) (\\(\\forall\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{K}\\)) satisfying: \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39; - P = \\mathcal{V} - P\\) \\((\\sigma_i,\\tau_i)\\in \\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) for \\(i=0,1,2,\\dots,r\\) Essentially, we keep the initial pairing of simplicies in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) that does not belong to the path \\(P\\), and assign those to \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\). And for simplicies in \\(P\\) with the original pairing \\(\\{\\tau^{n+1}_{i},\\sigma^n_{i+1}\\}\\), we change to \\((\\sigma_i,\\tau_i)\\) to put those in \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\). By definition, \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) is a discrete vector field because there are no simplicies appearing in more than a pair by the way we construct it. To show that \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) is a gradient vector field (by previous theorem , essentially pointing out there exists a discrete Morse function \\(f&#39;\\) satisfying the property), it’s sufficient to show that the exists no non-trivial closed V-paths and every V-path is unique. From (1), since \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) differs from \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) by \\(P\\) and there are no non-trivial or closed paths in \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) by definition, so there would not be any non-trivial paths in \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\). The V-path \\(P\\) is also non-trivial by definition, so if there were any trivial or closed paths in \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\), it would have been in some sub-path of \\(P\\). By way of contradiction, let’s suppose a closed sub-path \\(P_0\\) of \\(P\\) defined by \\(\\sigma^n_k,\\delta_i,\\dots,\\delta_j,\\sigma^n_k\\) for some \\(\\delta_i,\\dots,\\delta_j\\in\\mathcal{K}\\). Then \\(P&#39;= \\{\\sigma = \\sigma^{n}_{0},\\dots,\\sigma^n_k,\\delta_i,\\dots,\\delta_j,\\sigma^n_k,\\dots\\sigma^{n}_{r-1},\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1},\\sigma^{n}_{r},\\tau^n_r=\\tau\\}\\) is another \\(V-\\)path from \\(\\sigma\\) to \\(\\tau\\). This is a contradiction since any \\(V-\\)path from \\(\\sigma\\) to \\(\\tau\\) must be unique. Thus, \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) must not contain any closed V-path. We can show that every V-path in \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) is unique by a similar method. Again, since \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) differs from \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) by \\(P\\) so any V-path in \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;- P\\) is unique. Thus, it is sufficient to show that \\(P&#39;=\\{\\tau^{n+1}_{0},\\sigma^{n}_{1},\\tau^{n+1}_{1},\\sigma^{n}_{2},\\tau^{n}_{2},\\dots,\\sigma^{n}_{r-1},\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1},\\sigma^{n}_{r},\\tau^n_r=\\tau,\\sigma = \\sigma^{n}_{0}\\}\\) is unique. By way of contradiction, assume there exists another \\(V-\\)path from \\(\\tau^{n+1}_{0}\\) to \\(\\sigma\\): \\(P_0=\\{\\sigma = \\sigma^{n}_{0},\\dots,\\sigma^n_k,\\delta_i,\\dots,\\delta_j,\\sigma^n_k,\\dots\\sigma^{n}_{r-1},\\tau^{n+1}_{r-1},\\sigma^{n}_{r},\\tau^n_r=\\tau\\}\\). Then \\(P&#39;\\cup P_0\\) is a closed V-path, which contradicts the fact that \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) must not contain any closed V-path. Therefore, \\(\\mathcal{V}&#39;\\) is a gradient vector field of some discrete Morse function \\(f&#39;\\) satisfying that it has the same number of critical simplicies but \\(\\tau\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are no longer critical. 2.2 Morse Homology The connection between discrete Morse theory and simple homotopy arises from the pairs in the gradient vector field. The number of critical points modulo 2 of a Morse function depends only on the manifold and not on the function. Definition Chain Complex and Boundary Operator Let \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) be a simplicial complex, and \\(C_n(K)\\) denotes the \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\)-vector space with basis are the set of \\(k-\\)simplices contained in \\(\\mathcal{K}\\).

While this does yield a discrete Morse function, every simplex is critical, which is not at all helpful. In this section we give an algorithm, due to King et al. [97], that uses the values on the vertices to construct a gradient vector field on 𝐾 with “few” critical simplices. More details about this algorithm may be found in the original paper cited above or [99, Section 8.3]. Before presenting the algorithm, we fix some notation and terminology. Definition Collapse (simplicial complex) A collapse of an arbitrary simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) to \\(\\mathcal{K}&#39;\\) (denoted as \\(\\mathcal{K}\\searrow\\mathcal{K}&#39;\\)) is the removal of simplicies \\(\\Delta_\\gamma\\) such that \\(\\Delta_1\\subseteq\\Delta_\\gamma\\subseteq\\Delta_2\\) where \\(\\Delta_1\\) is a free-face. The main purpose is that \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) is homotopy equivalent to \\(\\mathcal{K}&#39;\\). Figure 2.6: Funky tikz Definition Level subcomplexes Let \\(c\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) be arbitrary, for a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) with a discrete Morse function \\(f:\\mathcal{K}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), the level sub-complexes is one induced by all simplicies \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{K}\\) satisfying \\(f(\\Delta)\\leq c\\) with all of their faces: \\[\\mathcal{K}(c) = \\bigcup_{f(\\Delta)\\leq c}\\bigcup_{\\Delta&#39;\\in\\partial\\Delta} \\Delta\\] Theorem The collapse theorem Let there be a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) with a discrete Morse function \\(f:\\mathcal{K}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\). For an arbitrary interval \\([a,b]\\) \\((\\forall a,b\\in\\mathbb{R})\\), if there exists no critical simplex \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{K}\\) induced by \\(f\\) such that \\(f(\\Delta_{\\text{Critical}})\\in [a,b]\\) then \\(\\mathcal{K}(b)\\searrow\\mathcal{K}(a)\\). Proof Let there be a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) with a discrete Morse function \\(f:\\mathcal{K}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\). Supposed that there exists no critical simplex \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{K}\\) induced by \\(f\\) such that \\(f(\\Delta_{\\text{Critical}})\\in [a,b]\\) for arbitrary interval \\([a,b]\\subset\\mathbb{R}\\). If for all arbitrary simplex \\(\\Delta \\in\\mathcal{K}\\), then \\(f(\\Delta)\\notin[a,b]\\) so \\(\\mathcal{K}(b)\\searrow\\mathcal{K}(a)\\). Otherwise, let arbitrary \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{K}\\) satisfying \\(f(\\Delta)\\in [a,b]\\) Definition Lower-star filtration Let \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) be a simplicial complex consisting of \\(m\\) simplices and an ordered sequences \\(S = \\Delta_1,\\Delta_2,\\dots\\Delta_m\\) where faces of \\(\\Delta_k\\) appears before \\(\\Delta_k\\) for \\(i=1,2,\\dots,m\\) "],["morse-segmentation-skeletonization.html", "Chapter 3 Morse segmentation/ skeletonization 3.1 The problem statement 3.2 Data collection and pre-processing 3.3 Result", " Chapter 3 Morse segmentation/ skeletonization 3.1 The problem statement 3.2 Data collection and pre-processing 3.3 Result "],["narcolepsy-analysis.html", "Chapter 4 Narcolepsy analysis 4.1 Graph skeletonization 4.2 Data collection and pre-processing 4.3 Result", " Chapter 4 Narcolepsy analysis 4.1 Graph skeletonization 4.2 Data collection and pre-processing 4.3 Result "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 5 Conclusion 5.1 Limitations and Future work 5.2 References", " Chapter 5 Conclusion 5.1 Limitations and Future work 5.2 References "]]
