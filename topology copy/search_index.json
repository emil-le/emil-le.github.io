Emil Le 2021-03-12 Preface The task of segmentation and finding the correspondence between visual dataset is a difficult challenge in the field of computer vision. Furthermore, there are many important practical invariant about an object such as its style, deformation, affinite rotation, noises etc that one have to consider when choosing the features for tackling the problem. Finding a global feature that is geometrically invariant to all of such could be a sensible approach to the solution, which is one of the fundamental motivation of topology. The idea of Morse theory (and discrete Morse theory) in differential topology is that a reasonable choice of a differential function can reflect a lot of information about a topological space. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Morse function 1.2 Discrete Morse theory", " Chapter 1 Introduction In simplest term, topologist differentiates abstract spaces by finding its homeomorphic invariant such as compactness, Hausdorff-“ness,” connectivity. There are many topological invariant that is helpful to assist doing such task. Similarly, Morse theory study a another type of invariant of differentiable manifold by looking at its differential function, specifically its critical values, defined on that space. Discrete Morse theory uses the same idea by turning these gradient field into “simpler” complexes that can represent the topological space. The fundamental idea of Morse theory is that a sensible differential function can inform a lot about a manifold, so what is consider a sensible function? Example Consider a unit sphere \\(S^2\\subset \\mathbb{R}^3\\) with the function \\(f\\) that collapse the sphere into the \\(z-\\)axis: \\[ \\begin{aligned} S^2 = \\{(x,y,z)&amp;\\vert x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\\} \\\\ \\\\ f\\text{ }: S^2 &amp;\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\\\ (x,y,z)&amp;\\longmapsto z \\end{aligned} \\] The gradient of \\(f\\) is \\(\\nabla f = [0 \\text{ } 0 \\text{ }1]^\\text{T}\\). Let \\(m\\in\\mathbb{R}\\), we can see that the critical point of \\(f\\) encodes information about the sub-level set of \\(S^2\\): Let \\(m\\subset \\mathcal{R}\\), consider the pre-image of M under \\(f\\): \\[ f^{-1}(m) = \\begin{cases} \\emptyset &amp;\\text{ if } m &lt; -1\\\\ (0,0,1)&amp;\\text{ if } m = -1\\\\ \\text{a circle } &amp;\\text{ if } -1&lt; m &lt; -1\\\\ (0,0,-1) &amp; \\text{ if } m &lt; = 1\\\\ \\emptyset &amp;\\text{ if } m &gt; 1 \\end{cases} \\] \\[ f^{-1}((-\\infty,m]) = \\begin{cases} \\emptyset &amp;\\text{ if } m &lt; -1\\\\ \\text{a point }&amp;\\text{ if } m = -1\\\\ \\text{a half-sphere } &amp;\\text{ if } -1&lt; m &lt; -1\\\\ S^2 &amp; \\text{ if } m \\geq 1\\\\ \\end{cases} \\] 1.1 Morse function Before we get into the definition of a Morse function, let’s recall some key definition: Definition (Manifold) An \\(n-\\)manifold \\(\\mathcal{M}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a \\(T_2\\) topological space (Hausdorff and with countable basis), where there exists a neighborhood \\(U\\subseteq \\mathcal{M}\\) for every \\(m\\in\\mathcal{M}\\) such that \\(U\\) is homeomorphic to an open ball in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) induced by the Eucledian metric. Definition (Critical Point) For an \\(n-\\)manifold \\(\\mathcal{M}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n\\), let \\(f: \\mathcal{M} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\). An critical point of \\(f\\) is \\(x\\in\\mathcal{M}\\) such that \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0\\) Intuitively, a Morse function is a function maps a manifold domain to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with all critical points are non-degenerative (local maximum, minimum, or saddle point). However, a function on a manifold domain does not have second-derivative, but we can define it on local point. Definition (Nondegenerative) Let \\(x \\in \\mathcal{M}\\) be a critical point of \\(f: \\mathcal{M} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\). Consider the tangent space at \\(x\\), \\(T_x\\mathcal{M}\\), let \\(\\vec{\\mathbf{u}},\\vec{\\mathbf{v}} \\in T_x\\mathcal{M}\\) be arbitrary. Define \\(\\partial^{2} f(\\vec{\\mathbf{u}},\\vec{\\mathbf{v}}) = \\vec{\\mathbf{u}}(\\vec{\\bar{\\mathbf{v}}}f)(x)\\), then the Hessians for \\(f\\) is given by: \\[ \\begin{align} \\mathbf{H}_{f_{ij}} &amp;\\equiv \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{i} \\partial x_{j} } \\\\ \\mathbf{H}_{f} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{1}^2} &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{1} \\partial x_{2} } &amp; \\dots &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{1} \\partial x_{n} } \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{2} \\partial x_{1} } &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{2}^2 } &amp; \\dots &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{2} \\partial x_{n} } \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp;\\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{n}\\partial x_{1}} &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{n} \\partial x_{2} } &amp; \\dots &amp; \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x_{n}^2 } \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align} \\] Definition (Morse Function) A Morse function is a function that the Hessian value of every critical point is non-degenerative. 1.2 Discrete Morse theory Definition For a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) and simplicies \\(\\Delta_1,\\Delta_2\\in \\mathcal{X}\\), if \\(\\Delta_1\\subset \\Delta_2\\) then (1) \\(\\Delta_1\\) is a face of \\(\\Delta_2\\) (\\(\\Delta_1\\in\\partial\\Delta_2\\)) (2) \\(\\Delta_2\\) is a coface of \\(\\Delta_1\\). If \\(\\dim\\Delta_1=\\dim\\Delta_2-1\\) then \\(\\Delta_1\\) is a facet of \\(\\Delta_2\\) and \\(\\Delta_2\\) is a co-facet of \\(\\Delta_1.\\) Definition: Discrete Morse function For a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), a discrete Morse function \\(f:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) must satisfied the conidtion: \\(\\text{Card}\\left\\{\\Delta_1 \\big\\vert f(\\Delta_1)\\leq f(\\Delta_2), \\Delta_1\\in\\partial\\Delta_2\\right\\} \\leq 1\\) \\(\\text{Card}\\left\\{\\Delta_3 \\big\\vert f(\\Delta_3)\\leq f(\\Delta_2), \\Delta_2\\in\\partial\\Delta_3\\right\\} \\leq 1\\) Example For a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), the function \\(f:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) defined by \\(\\Delta\\mapsto\\dim(\\Delta)\\) is a discrete Morse function Definition: Critical simplex For a simplicial complex \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) and a discrete Morse function \\(f:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), a simplex \\(\\Delta_2\\in\\mathcal{X}\\) is a critical simplex if: \\(\\text{Card}\\left\\{\\Delta_1 \\big\\vert f(\\Delta_1)\\leq f(\\Delta_2), \\Delta_1\\in\\partial\\Delta_2\\right\\} = 0\\) \\(\\text{Card}\\left\\{\\Delta_3 \\big\\vert f(\\Delta_3)\\leq f(\\Delta_2), \\Delta_2\\in\\partial\\Delta_3\\right\\} = 0\\) Definition A discrete vector field \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is a collected of pairs of simplices \\((\\Delta^n_\\alpha,\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta)\\) such that each simplex appear at most 1 pair satisfying \\((\\Delta^n_\\alpha\\subset\\Delta^{n+1}_\\beta)\\) "]]
